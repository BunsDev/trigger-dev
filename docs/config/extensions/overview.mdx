Build extension allow you to hook into the build system and customize the build process or the resulting bundle and container image (in the case of deploying). See our [trigger.config.ts reference](/config/config-file#extensions) for more information on how to install and use our built-in extensions. Build extensions can do the following:

- Add additional files to the build
- Add esbuild plugins
- Add additional npm dependencies
- Add additional system packages to the image build container
- Add commands to run in the image build container
- Add environment variables to the image build container
- Sync environment variables to your Trigger.dev project

## Creating a build extension

Build extensions are added to your `trigger.config.ts` file, with a required `name` and optional build hook functions. Here's a simple example of a build extension that just logs a message when the build starts:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "my-project",
  build: {
    extensions: [
      {
        name: "my-extension",
        onBuildStart: async (context) => {
          console.log("Build starting!");
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

You can also extract that out into a function instead of defining it inline, in which case you will need to import the `BuildExtension` type from the `@trigger.dev/build` package:

<Note>
  You'll need to add the `@trigger.dev/build` package to your `devDependencies` before the below
  code will work. Make sure it's version matches that of the installed `@trigger.dev/sdk` package.
</Note>

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { BuildExtension } from "@trigger.dev/build";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "my-project",
  build: {
    extensions: [myExtension()],
  },
});

function myExtension(): BuildExtension {
  return {
    name: "my-extension",
    onBuildStart: async (context) => {
      console.log("Build starting!");
    },
  };
}
```
